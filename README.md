## FeedBack

I decided to select the project with the Spotify API because I never worked on it and this is a product that I use every day :D
I spend a few time to know how it's working but it's very cool to use.

I didn't have a lot of time these last days, with the kids at home but here is my code.

Comments:

- I didn't want to use a state manager like vuex because the project is too small.
- To be completely honest, I copy/paste the code of the modal because I didn't want to spend a lot of time with his style.
- This is the first time I use the composition API. Really interesting even if I didn't use it very deeply.

What I want to improve:

- Add unit tests on search input and the actions of users (ex: click on artists cards)
- If I'll have more time, I would like to improve my api function specially with the token. (ex: create a class and store the token on it at his first instance)
